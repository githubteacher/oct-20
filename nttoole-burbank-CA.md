# Burbank, CA

### Places to Eat
When at Universal, go to the Hard Rock Cafe.  They have a decent happy hour.
BJs near the 5 freeway has good pizza and beer.

### Things to see
St Josephs Hospital, where I was born.  I don't recall the building or room number tho, so search around.

### Things to do
Visit Universal Studios
Watch a movie at one of the theaters
Visit the Sci-Fi themed Frys, tho I wouldn't recommend buying anything that is marked as opened/returned.
